      "[Oct 30 2009 \tOK value though shabby; good position.\tI extended a one night stay to three. The staff were basically helpful when asked. My room was clean, comfortable, and daily serviced. I think the position is good for a budget hotel, near the Golden Gate theatre, right by Asian Arts Museum and Civic Centre. It's an old and architecturally atmospheric hotel.Negatives: it is very badly neglected. Things that might put you off are the need usually to ring the outside doorbell and wait to get someone to the unattended reception, unreliable breakfast availability (nil when I was there but I can see from other reviews that it can appear!), a very unreliable (but rather beautiful) classic Otis elevator, some very dilapidated corridors on the way to your room when the elevator is kaput, shabby though formerly elegant decor, homeless on nearby streets, though the street immediately outside was clear and felt safe and I didn't see any drug taking or pushing and I was never bothered anywhere. However, I rather liked both hotel and neighbourhood and felt it was OK value. One thing - when I extended my stay they raised the rate above the internet rate which was in the fifties to $70.\t]\n"
