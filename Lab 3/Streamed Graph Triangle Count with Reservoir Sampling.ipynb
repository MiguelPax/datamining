    "A wedge is closed if it participates in a triangle, otherwise it is open. Note that the transitivity (= 3T/W) is exactly the probability that a uniform random wedge is closed. This leads to a simple randomized algorithm for estimating transivity (and triangle count) by sampling a set of independent uniform random wedges and finding the fraction of closed wedges. \n",
